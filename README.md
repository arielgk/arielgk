### What am I doing now?- Building games as a solo developer under my own brand â€” from concept to release.
- Exploring cloud and local LLM integration in mobile and desktop applications.
- Applying advanced patterns in Unity and C# for scalable, maintainable game development (e.g. KuDI â€“ a custom dependency injection system).


I am currently employed by a video game company where I develop apps for iOS and Android. Initially, my role involved creating user experiences and working with various technologies such as machine learning, TensorFlow, React, Unity, C#, OpenCV, and Laravel.

Currently, my focus has shifted to building complete games using Unity and C# from start to finish.

Prior to this, I worked at a Telecommunication Company as a developer, primarily involved in building apps for TV (OTT). During that time, I gained extensive knowledge of players and streaming technologies such as Dash, Widevine, and HLS.
